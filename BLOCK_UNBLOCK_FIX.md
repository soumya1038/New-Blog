# Block/Unblock Feature Fix

## ✅ Problems Fixed

### 1. Block Not Working
**Issue**: After blocking a user, they could still send messages

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Backend checks if user is blocked before sending message
- ✅ Socket checks if user is blocked in real-time
- ✅ Blocked users get error message
- ✅ Messages cannot be sent to/from blocked users

### 2. No Unblock Feature
**Issue**: Once blocked, no way to unblock a user

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Added unblock endpoint
- ✅ Menu shows "Unblock user" for blocked users
- ✅ Menu shows "Block user" for non-blocked users
- ✅ Can toggle block/unblock easily

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Blocking a User
```
1. Click three dots on conversation
2. Click "Block user"
3. Confirm dialog
4. User is blocked
5. Conversation removed
6. Cannot send/receive messages
```

### Unblocking a User
```
1. Search for blocked user
2. Click three dots
3. See "Unblock user" (green)
4. Click to unblock
5. Confirm dialog
6. User is unblocked
7. Can message again
```

## 🔒 Block Behavior

### When You Block Someone

**What Happens:**
- ✅ All messages deleted
- ✅ Conversation removed from list
- ✅ They cannot send you messages
- ✅ You cannot send them messages
- ✅ They don't know they're blocked

**What They See:**
- Your conversation disappears
- If they try to message: "You cannot send messages to this user"
- No notification that they're blocked

### When Someone Blocks You

**What Happens:**
- ✅ Conversation disappears
- ✅ Cannot send messages
- ✅ Get error: "You cannot send messages to this user"

**What You See:**
- Conversation removed
- Error message when trying to send
- No explicit "You are blocked" message

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Checks

**API Endpoint (sendMessage):**
```javascript
// Check if sender is blocked by receiver
if (receiver.blockedUsers.includes(senderId)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    message: 'You cannot send messages to this user' 
  });
}

// Check if receiver is blocked by sender
if (sender.blockedUsers.includes(receiverId)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    message: 'You have blocked this user' 
  });
}
```

**Socket Event (message:send):**
```javascript
// Check if blocked before sending
const receiver = await User.findById(receiverId);
const sender = await User.findById(senderId);

if (receiver.blockedUsers.includes(senderId)) {
  socket.emit('message:error', { 
    error: 'You cannot send messages to this user' 
  });
  return;
}
```

### New Endpoints

**POST /api/messages/block/:userId**
- Adds user to blockedUsers array
- Deletes all messages between users
- Returns success message

**POST /api/messages/unblock/:userId**
- Removes user from blockedUsers array
- Returns success message

**GET /api/messages/blocked-users**
- Returns list of blocked users
- Used to show correct menu option

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Menu Options

**For Non-Blocked Users:**
```
Three dots menu:
├── Mute/Unmute notifications
├── Clear messages
├── Delete conversation
└── Block user (red) ← Shows this
```

**For Blocked Users:**
```
Three dots menu:
└── Unblock user (green) ← Shows this instead
```

### Visual Indicators

**Block Button:**
- Red color
- "Block user" text
- Warning icon (FiUserX)

**Unblock Button:**
- Green color
- "Unblock user" text
- Same icon (FiUserX)
