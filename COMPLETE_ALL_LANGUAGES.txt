# INSTRUCTION TO COMPLETE ALL LANGUAGES

Since Bengali is now 100% complete (same as Hindi), I need to do the same for ALL other languages.

## Quick Fix Approach:

For each language (Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Portuguese):

1. Copy the ENTIRE Bengali translation object structure
2. Replace ONLY the translated strings with the target language
3. Keep all the keys exactly the same

This ensures 100% coverage for all languages.

## Languages that need FULL translation (like Bengali):
- Telugu (te)
- Marathi (mr)
- Tamil (ta)
- Gujarati (gu)
- Kannada (kn)
- Malayalam (ml)
- Punjabi (pa)
- Spanish (es) - Already has some, needs completion
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Chinese (zh)
- Japanese (ja)
- Arabic (ar)
- Portuguese (pt)

## Current Status:
✅ English - 100%
✅ Hindi - 100%
✅ Bengali - 100% (JUST COMPLETED)
❌ Other 14 languages - Need completion

The issue was: Other languages only had ~10-15 translations, but Bengali/Hindi have ~150 translations.

Solution: Copy Bengali structure, translate the values.
