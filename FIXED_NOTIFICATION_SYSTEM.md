# Fixed Notification System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navbar Badge Not Showing
**Problem:** Badge wasn't appearing even with unread notifications
**Cause:** Incorrect API URL in fetch call
**Fix:** Added proper base URL and headers
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000'}/api/social/notifications`, {
  headers: { 
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

### 2. Missing Unread Dots on Cards
**Problem:** Removed auto-mark-all which made "Mark all read" button useless
**Cause:** Auto-marking all as read on page load
**Fix:** 
- Removed `markAllAsRead()` from useEffect
- Added back blue dot indicator for unread notifications
- Added blue background for unread cards

## Current Behavior

### Unread Notifications:
- ✅ Blue background (bg-blue-50)
- ✅ Blue border (border-blue-300)
- ✅ Small blue dot in top-right corner
- ✅ Hover: darker blue (bg-blue-100)

### Read Notifications:
- ✅ White background
- ✅ Gray border (border-gray-200)
- ✅ No dot
- ✅ Hover: light gray (bg-gray-50)

### Navbar Badge:
- ✅ Shows unread count (1, 2, 3... or 9+)
- ✅ Red background with pulse animation
- ✅ Updates in real-time
- ✅ Disappears when count = 0

## User Flow

### Receiving Notification:
1. New notification arrives
2. Navbar badge shows count (e.g., "3")
3. Badge pulses (animated)
4. Sound plays (if message)

### Viewing Notifications:
1. User clicks bell icon
2. Opens /notifications page
3. Sees list with unread (blue) and read (white) cards
4. Unread cards have small blue dot

### Marking as Read:
**Option 1: Click individual notification**
- Click card → Marks as read → Navigates to destination
- Dot disappears, background turns white
- Badge count decreases

**Option 2: Click "Mark all read" button**
- All notifications marked as read
- All dots disappear
- All backgrounds turn white
- Badge disappears

### "Mark All Read" Button Value:
- User can see all notifications without clicking each one
- Useful when user just wants to clear the badge
- Batch operation instead of one-by-one

## Visual Design

### Compact Card Layout:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ❤️ [Avatar] Username message  🔵  │ ← Unread (blue bg + dot)
│              Date and time          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💬 [Avatar] Username message       │ ← Read (white bg, no dot)
│              Date and time          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dot Indicator:
- Size: 2.5 x 2.5 (w-2.5 h-2.5)
- Color: Blue (bg-blue-500)
- Position: Top-right corner (top-2 right-2)
- Shape: Rounded full circle
- No animation (static, not pulsing)

### Badge Indicator:
- Size: 5 x 5 (h-5 w-5)
- Color: Red (bg-red-500)
- Position: Top-right of bell (-top-2 -right-2)
- Animation: Pulse (animate-pulse)
- Text: White, bold, centered
