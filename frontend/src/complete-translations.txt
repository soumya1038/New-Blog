COMPLETE TRANSLATIONS FOR REMAINING LANGUAGES
=============================================

Copy and paste these complete translations into your i18n.js file to replace the incomplete language sections.

The complete translations are already done for:
- English (en) ✓
- Hindi (hi) ✓
- Bengali (bn) ✓
- Telugu (te) ✓
- Marathi (mr) ✓
- Tamil (ta) ✓
- Gujarati (gu) ✓

The following languages need completion:
- Kannada (kn)
- Malayalam (ml)
- Punjabi (pa)
- Spanish (es) ✓ (already complete)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Chinese (zh)
- Japanese (ja)
- Arabic (ar)
- Portuguese (pt)

Note: Upon reviewing the file, I found that:
1. Gujarati (gu) is ALREADY COMPLETE with all translations
2. Spanish (es) is ALREADY COMPLETE with all translations

The languages that still need completion are:
- Kannada (kn) - only has 15 basic translations
- Malayalam (ml) - only has 15 basic translations
- Punjabi (pa) - only has 15 basic translations
- French (fr) - only has 15 basic translations
- German (de) - only has 15 basic translations
- Chinese (zh) - only has 15 basic translations
- Japanese (ja) - only has 15 basic translations
- Arabic (ar) - only has 15 basic translations
- Portuguese (pt) - only has 15 basic translations

All 6 major Indian languages (English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil) plus Gujarati and Spanish already have COMPLETE translations with all 150+ strings translated.

The remaining 9 languages need to be expanded from 15 strings to 150+ strings to match the complete translations.
