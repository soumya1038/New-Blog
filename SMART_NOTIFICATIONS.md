# Smart Notification System

## ✅ Problem Fixed

### Issue
When both users have chat open with each other:
- User A sends message
- User B sees the message (chat is open)
- But B also gets notification sound 🔊
- And sees count badge (1, 2, 3...)
- **This is annoying!** B is already reading the messages!

### Expected Behavior
- If chat is **OPEN** → Just show message, NO sound, NO badge
- If chat is **CLOSED** → Show notification sound + badge

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Chat is OPEN
```
User A and B both have chat open with each other

A sends: "Hello"
→ B sees message appear instantly ✓
→ NO notification sound 🔇
→ NO count badge ✓
→ Message marked as read automatically ✓

A sends: "How are you?"
→ B sees message appear ✓
→ Still NO sound 🔇
→ Still NO badge ✓
```

### Scenario 2: Chat is CLOSED
```
User B is NOT in chat with A (or chat app closed)

A sends: "Hello"
→ B gets notification sound 🔊
→ B sees count badge: 1
→ B opens chat
→ Badge clears, sound stops ✓
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Chats
```
User B has chat open with User A
User C sends message to B

C's message:
→ B gets notification sound 🔊 (chat with C is closed)
→ B sees badge on C's conversation: 1

A's message:
→ B sees message instantly ✓
→ NO sound 🔇 (chat with A is open)
→ NO badge ✓
```

## 🔧 Implementation

### Logic
```javascript
socket.on('message:receive', (message) => {
  // Check if chat is open with sender
  const isChatOpen = selectedChat && message.sender._id === selectedChat._id;
  
  if (isChatOpen) {
    // Chat OPEN: Just add message
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, message]);
    socket.emit('message:read', message._id);
    // NO SOUND, NO BADGE
  } else {
    // Chat CLOSED: Show notification
    soundNotification.playReceiveSound(); // 🔊
    // Badge will show via loadConversations()
  }
  
  loadConversations(); // Update counts
});
```

### Key Points
1. **Check if chat is open**: `selectedChat._id === message.sender._id`
2. **If open**: Add message silently
3. **If closed**: Play sound + show badge
4. **Always**: Refresh conversation list

## 📊 Comparison

### Before (Annoying)
```
Chat Open:
A: "Hi"           → B: 🔊 Sound + Badge (1)
A: "How are you?" → B: 🔊 Sound + Badge (2)
A: "Hello?"       → B: 🔊 Sound + Badge (3)

Result: B is annoyed! Already reading messages!
```

### After (Smart)
```
Chat Open:
A: "Hi"           → B: Message appears (no sound)
A: "How are you?" → B: Message appears (no sound)
A: "Hello?"       → B: Message appears (no sound)

Result: B can read peacefully! ✓
```

## 📱 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Active Conversation
```
You and friend are chatting:
Friend: "What time?" → You see it (no sound)
You: "3 PM"
Friend: "Perfect!" → You see it (no sound)
You: "See you"
Friend: "👍" → You see it (no sound)

✓ Natural conversation flow
✓ No annoying notifications
```

### Example 2: Background Message
```
You're chatting with Friend A
Friend B sends message

Friend B's message:
→ 🔊 Sound plays
→ Badge shows: 1
→ You can finish chat with A
→ Then check B's message

✓ You're notified about B
✓ Not interrupted in chat with A
```

### Example 3: Multiple Messages
```
You're away from chat
Friend sends 5 messages

First message:
→ 🔊 Sound plays
→ Badge: 1

Messages 2-5:
→ Badge updates: 2, 3, 4, 5
→ Sound plays for each

You open chat:
→ All messages visible
→ Badge clears to 0
→ All marked as read

✓ You were properly notified
✓ Counts were accurate
```

## 🎯 Technical Details

### State Check
```javascript
const isChatOpen = selectedChat && message.sender._id === selectedChat._id;
```

**Checks:**
- `selectedChat` exists (not null)
- `message.sender._id` matches `selectedChat._id`
- Both conditions must be true

### Message Handling
```javascript
if (isChatOpen) {
  // Silent update
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, message]);
  markAsRead(message._id);
} else {
  // Notify user
  playSound();
  showBadge();
}
```
