## 🎵 Technical Details

### Active Chat Sound (New)
```javascript
playReceiveSoundActive() {
  oscillator.frequency.value = 700;  // Mid frequency
  oscillator.type = 'sine';          // Smooth tone
  gainNode.gain = 0.15;              // 50% quieter
  duration = 0.08s;                  // 20% shorter
}
```

**Why these values?**
- **700Hz**: Pleasant, not too high or low
- **15% volume**: Quiet enough to not interrupt
- **0.08s**: Quick, doesn't linger
- **Sine wave**: Smooth, professional sound

### Alert Sound (Existing)
```javascript
playReceiveSound() {
  // First beep: 600Hz, 0.1s
  // Second beep: 800Hz, 0.1s (after 0.15s)
  // Total: 0.25s
  // Volume: 30%
}
```

**Why double beep?**
- More noticeable
- Grabs attention
- Indicates "new" message
- Different from active chat

  playReceiveSoundActive(); // 🔔
  showMessage();
  markAsRead();
} else {
  // Alert sound - get your attention
  playReceiveSound(); // 🔊🔊
  showBadge();
}

// When you send
onClick(send) {
  playSendSound(); // 🔊
  sendMessage();
}
```
