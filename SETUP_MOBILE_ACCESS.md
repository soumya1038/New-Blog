# Quick Setup for Mobile Access

## üöÄ Step-by-Step:

### 1. Find Your Laptop's IP Address

**Open Command Prompt (Windows) and run:**
```bash
ipconfig
```

**Look for:** `IPv4 Address` under your WiFi adapter
**Example:** `192.168.1.5` or `192.168.0.105`

**Copy this IP address!**

---

### 2. Create `.env` file in Frontend

**File:** `frontend/.env`

Create this file and add:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://YOUR_LAPTOP_IP:5000
```

**Example:**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.1.5:5000
```

Replace `YOUR_LAPTOP_IP` with the IP you found in step 1.

---

### 3. Update Backend to Listen on All Interfaces

**Already done!** ‚úÖ I've updated `backend/server.js` to allow connections from your network.

---

### 4. Restart Both Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

---

### 5. Access from Your Mobile Phone

**Open browser on your phone and go to:**
```
http://YOUR_LAPTOP_IP:3000
```

**Example:**
```
http://192.168.1.5:3000
```

## üéØ Example Setup:

**My laptop IP:** `192.168.1.5`

**Frontend `.env`:**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.1.5:5000

## üí° Pro Tips:

1. **Keep laptop plugged in** - WiFi might disconnect on battery
2. **Don't close laptop lid** - Might disconnect WiFi
3. **Use same WiFi** - Both devices must be on same network
4. **Check router** - Some routers have "AP Isolation" that blocks device-to-device communication

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### "Can't reach this page"
- Check both devices on same WiFi
- Check firewall settings
- Verify IP address is correct
- Try `ping YOUR_LAPTOP_IP` from phone (use network tools app)

### "API Error" or "Network Error"
- Check backend is running
- Check `.env` file has correct IP
- Check CORS is enabled (already done)
- Restart both servers

### Chat not working
- Check Socket.io connection in browser console
- Verify backend shows "Socket connected"
- Check firewall allows port 5000
