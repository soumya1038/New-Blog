# Call System Bugs - FIXED

## Bugs Fixed:

### âœ… Bug 1: Call Doesn't End for Both Users
**Problem**: User A ends call, but User B still sees active call screen
**Root Cause**: `call:end` event not properly cleaning up remote user's state
**Fix**: 
- Added comprehensive state cleanup in `call:ended` listener
- Reset all call-related states: activeCall, incomingCall, isCallMinimized, audio/video flags
- Added logging to track event flow

### âœ… Bug 2: Duplicate Call Listeners
**Problem**: Both App.js and ChatNew.jsx listening to `call:incoming`
**Root Cause**: No route check in ChatNew.jsx
**Fix**:
- ChatNew.jsx now checks `if (window.location.pathname === '/chat')` before handling
- App.js handles all other routes
- Prevents duplicate modals

### âœ… Bug 3: Call State Persists When Leaving Chat
**Problem**: User leaves /chat page with active call, call doesn't end
**Root Cause**: No cleanup in useEffect return
**Fix**:
- Added cleanup in ChatNew.jsx useEffect return
- Emits `call:end` to remote user
- Calls `webrtcService.endCall()` to cleanup streams

### âœ… Bug 4: Rejected Call Not Logged
**Problem**: When user rejects call, no record in call history
**Root Cause**: No API call to update call log
**Fix**:
- Added `api.put()` call in `rejectCall()` function
- Updates call log status to 'rejected'

### âœ… Bug 5: Global Call End Not Syncing
**Problem**: Call ended in App.js but ChatNew.jsx doesn't know
**Root Cause**: No communication between components
**Fix**:
- App.js dispatches `callEnded` custom event
- ChatNew.jsx listens for event and cleans up state
- Ensures sync across all components

## Testing Checklist:

### Test 1: End Call Synchronization
- [ ] User A calls User B
- [ ] Both accept and connect
- [ ] User A clicks "End Call"
- [ ] **Expected**: Both users' call screens close immediately
- [ ] **Expected**: Console shows "Call ended by remote user" on User B

### Test 2: Reject Call
- [ ] User A calls User B
- [ ] User B clicks "Reject"
- [ ] **Expected**: User A sees "Call Rejected" message
- [ ] **Expected**: User B's incoming call modal closes
- [ ] **Expected**: Call log shows status as "rejected"

### Test 3: Leave Chat During Call
- [ ] User A and User B in active call
- [ ] User A navigates away from /chat (e.g., clicks Home)
- [ ] **Expected**: Call ends for both users
- [ ] **Expected**: User B sees call ended
- [ ] **Expected**: Streams are cleaned up

### Test 4: No Duplicate Modals
- [ ] User A on /chat page
- [ ] User B calls User A
- [ ] **Expected**: Only ONE incoming call modal appears
- [ ] **Expected**: Console shows "ChatNew: Incoming call received"

### Test 5: Global Call End Sync
- [ ] User A on home page, receives call
- [ ] User A accepts (navigates to /chat)
- [ ] User B ends call
- [ ] **Expected**: User A's call screen closes
- [ ] **Expected**: User A can continue using chat normally

### Test 6: Multiple Rapid Calls
- [ ] User A calls User B
- [ ] User B rejects
- [ ] User A immediately calls again
- [ ] **Expected**: New call modal appears
- [ ] **Expected**: No ghost calls or stuck states

## Console Logs to Watch:

When testing, you should see these logs:

**Initiating Call:**
```
ðŸ“ž Emitting call:initiate to: [userId]
âœ… Call initiated with offer sent
```

**Receiving Call:**
```
ðŸ“ž App.js: Global incoming call: {...}  (if not on /chat)
ðŸ“ž ChatNew: Incoming call received: {...}  (if on /chat)
```

**Ending Call:**
```
ðŸ“ž Ending call, notifying remote user: [userId]
ðŸ“ž Call ended by remote user  (on remote user's console)
ðŸ“ž App.js: Call ended
ðŸ“ž ChatNew: Received global call end event
```

**Rejecting Call:**
```
ðŸ“ž Rejecting call from: [userId]
ðŸ“ž App.js: Call rejected
```

## Known Remaining Issues:

1. **Mobile HTTPS**: Still requires HTTPS for mobile testing (use ngrok)
2. **Network Issues**: Poor network may cause ICE connection failures
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome/Edge, may need testing on Safari/Firefox
