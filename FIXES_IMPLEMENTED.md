# Fixes Implemented - Call System Issues

## ✅ Issue 1: Status Border Disappearing - FIXED
**Problem**: Status borders disappeared after page reload
**Solution**: 
- Store `viewedStatuses` in localStorage
- Load from localStorage on component mount
- Auto-save whenever viewedStatuses changes

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/ChatNew.jsx` - Added localStorage persistence

---

## ✅ Issue 3: Video Calls Not Working - FIXED  
**Problem**: WebRTC offer/answer not being exchanged between peers
**Root Cause**: `createOffer()` and `createAnswer()` methods weren't emitting to socket

**Solution**:
1. Modified `webrtcService.createOffer(receiverId)` to emit offer to socket
2. Modified `webrtcService.createAnswer(callerId)` to emit answer to socket
3. Updated ChatNew.jsx to call `createOffer()` when initiating call
4. Updated ChatNew.jsx to call `createAnswer()` when receiving offer
5. Added proper callerId/receiverId parameters

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/webrtc.js` - Added socket emissions
- `frontend/src/pages/ChatNew.jsx` - Added offer/answer creation calls

**How It Works Now**:
```
Caller                          Receiver
  |                                |
  |------ call:initiate --------->|
  |                                |
  |------- call:offer ----------->| (with SDP offer)
  |                                |
  |<------ call:answer -----------| (with SDP answer)
  |                                |
  |<----- ICE candidates -------->|
  |                                |
  [Connected!]
```

## ⚠️ Issue 2: Calls Only Work in /chat Route - PARTIAL
**Status**: Documented, requires App.js level implementation
**Solution**: Move call socket listeners to App.js so they work globally

**Next Steps**:
- Move `call:incoming`, `call:accepted`, `call:rejected`, `call:ended` listeners to App.js
- Create global IncomingCallModal that works across all routes
- This will allow users to receive calls even when not on /chat page

## ⚠️ Issue 4: Mobile "Fail to Start Call" - PARTIAL
**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **HTTPS Required**: WebRTC requires HTTPS on mobile (localhost doesn't work)
2. **Permissions**: Need explicit camera/mic permissions
3. **Better Error Messages**: Added detailed error handling

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Better error messages for NotAllowedError, NotReadableError, NotFoundError
- ✅ Improved stream cleanup before starting new calls

**Still Needed for Full Mobile Support**:
- Use ngrok or deploy to HTTPS server for mobile testing
- Test on actual mobile devices over HTTPS

**Mobile Testing Setup**:
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Start frontend
npm start

# In another terminal, create HTTPS tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# Use the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io) on your mobile device
```

## Testing Results:

### Desktop (Localhost):
- ✅ Audio calls work
- ✅ Video calls work  
- ✅ Status borders persist after reload
- ✅ Offer/answer exchange successful

### Mobile (Requires HTTPS):
- ⏳ Pending HTTPS setup with ngrok
- ⏳ Need to test camera/mic permissions
- ⏳ Need to test call quality over mobile network

---

## Known Limitations:

1. **Calls only work when both users are on /chat route** - Need to implement global call listeners
2. **Mobile requires HTTPS** - Use ngrok or deploy to production for mobile testing
3. **No call ringing sound** - Consider adding ringtone audio

---

## Recommendations:

1. **For Production**: Deploy to HTTPS server (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
2. **For Development**: Use ngrok for mobile testing
3. **Future Enhancement**: Implement global call system that works across all routes
4. **Future Enhancement**: Add TURN server for better NAT traversal (currently only using STUN)
